# CrowdClimbz

## Project Goals
CrowdClimbz is a mobile application that encourages and enables climbers to create and share their own indoor bouldering problems. Our application focuses on the importance of building community among rock climbers through simple features for climbers to receive feedback from others in their gym communities. 

CrowdClimbz differs from other applications currently on the market in that it offers simple, streamlined features for marking projects, independent of the gym or rock wall used. It emphasizes sharing and commenting on othersâ€™ work rather than simply creating a bank of projects for oneself. We hope that this application will help new climbers who want to discover more projects at their level as well as seasoned climbers who are looking for more challenges.
