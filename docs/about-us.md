Hi, I'm Laura Silvashy, and I'm studying computer science and mathematics at the University of Alabama. When I'm not diligently working on my CS 495 project, I can often be found rock climbing or working at my job with Outdoor Recreation on campus. I am also very involved with my church in Tuscaloosa. I love spending time outside, playing board games, and rewatching *The Office* on Netflix. After I graduate in May, I will be moving to Cincinnati, getting married to my amazing fianc√©, Stephen, and starting a job as a data scientist at 84.51&deg;.
