My name is Bailey Gulsby, and I am studying computer science at the University of Alabama. My development experience includes my class projects and a couple of projects with Dr. Carver and the School of Social Work building web and mobile apps. Outside of software development I enjoy traveling with friends and playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate with my roommates. I have had the chance to travel to many interesting places including New Orleans, Atlanta, Pensacola, and Tijuana. In May I will be graduating and working full-time in Huntsville, AL with 3-GIS.

Hi, I'm Laura Silvashy, and I'm studying computer science and mathematics at the University of Alabama. When I'm not diligently working on my CS 495 project, I can often be found rock climbing or working at my job with Outdoor Recreation on campus. I am also very involved with my church in Tuscaloosa. I love spending time outside, playing board games, and rewatching *The Office* on Netflix. After I graduate in May, I will be moving to Cincinnati, getting married to my amazing fianc√©, Stephen, and starting a job as a data scientist at 84.51&deg;.
